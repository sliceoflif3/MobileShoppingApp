# Shopping app 
Made by Nguyen Quang Long and Truong Nhat Minh
This is a project for our Midterm exam on the course CS426 - Mobile Device Application Development.

Some special features of our app:
- Show a list of products on the main screen, their prices and descriptions.
- Check the detail of each product, choose whether to add it to cart or not
- At the cart tab, we can see the total price + tax depend on your location, shipping fee, etc.
- An instance to Google Map API, which show your location, and nearby shops that sale the corresponding products.
